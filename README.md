# üöÄ Parallel Matrix Multiplication in Java

This project demonstrates how to efficiently perform **matrix multiplication** using **Java's multithreading capabilities**. By distributing the workload across multiple threads, it significantly improves performance on multi-core processors.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üîÅ Parallel Processing**: Leverages Java threads for concurrent matrix computation.
* **üéõÔ∏è Dynamic Input**: Accepts matrix dimensions and elements via console input.
* **üß† Smart Thread Management**: Automatically detects available CPU cores to decide thread count.
* **üìä Detailed Output**: Displays thread metadata (ID, Name, Priority, State, Assigned Rows) and final results.

## üß† How It Works

The core idea is to **divide the matrix multiplication** into smaller chunks and execute them **simultaneously** using threads.

### üß≠ `ThreadCaller` (The Orchestrator)

* Accepts user input for **Matrix A** and **Matrix B** using `Scanner`.
* Validates matrix dimensions for compatibility.
* Determines the **optimal thread count** (based on CPU cores).
* Splits rows of the result matrix between threads.
* Spawns and starts `ChildThread` instances.
* Waits for all threads to finish using `.join()`.
* Prints the final result matrix.

### üßµ `ChildThread` (The Worker Bee)

* Each thread is responsible for **a range of rows** in the result matrix.
* Receives:

  * References to Matrix A, Matrix B
  * Its assigned `startRow`, `endRow`
  * Shared `resultMatrix`
* Performs matrix multiplication logic in its `run()` method.
* Prints status (start and finish), along with:

  * `ID`, `Name`, `Priority`, `State`, and `Assigned Rows`

> This parallel model ensures **faster execution** by utilizing all available processor cores.
